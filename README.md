# ♻️Stealth Startup Project

One of my family members is planning to launch a local startup in San Jose by May 2023. I won't tell what exactly the startup is about, but I can say it is a consumer service startup.

I am doing the analytics work for them so they can reach their ambitious goals.

## I am helping them out with analytics including:<br>
🗺️ Analyze and visualize potential service areas via Bokeh and Google Maps API<br>
📑 Manage a dataset of +1,000 addresses to target areas by day to advertise the service & product<br>
📈 Communicate with CEO to plan marketing and service operation based on analysis results<br>

I will be using Python Jupyter Notebook for this repo. All address found in the 'data' folder do not represent actual customers' locations. They were selected purely randomly.

Above is a sample image of "Potential_Customers_Map" in the repo. Any information uploaded in this repo will not include actual customer information for privacy purposes (all geographic information uploaded here are not actual customers' addresses).
